### Conclusions on the Outcomes based on Launch Date?
1. The purpose of the is to help Louise understand how different Kickstarter campaigns performed in relation to their launch dates and their funding goals. We used the Kickstarter dataset that we combed through the data and visualize campaign outcomes based on their launch dates and their funding goals. We created pivot tables to sort and filter through data in order to get a more accurate information. We started with outcomes based on launch date. Our second graph involved visualizing the percentage of successful, failed, and canceled plays based on the funding goal amount. Although I did not have any challenges creating the above analysis, I could see how someone could have come across analysis. During the second deliverable, I attempted to create a pivot table to create a graph that visualized the percentage of successful, failed and canceled plays based on funding goals. I noticed that my “less than 1000” cell in the “goal” column was being filtered as the last in the column when instead it needed to be the first. I quickly fixed the issue by hiding the columns I did not need and inserting the graph without needing to create a pivot table.

### Conclusion about the Outcomes based on Goals?
From our analysis on theater outcomes based on launch date, we can conclude May and June is the best time to create a Kickstarter campaign as it was the most successful. November and December are the worst times to create a campaign. From our analysis on outcomes based on goals, we can conclude that campaigns with goals of 20,000-30,000 have the best percentage to be successful. Goals over 40,000 have the biggest chance of failing.



###  Limitations of this dataset?
I think one limitation we had was not able to determine what genre of “plays” were being offered. There could be certain genres that are most likely to be successful or fail. We also did not filter by country. Some countries can more popularity with plays as opposed to others.

### Other possible tables and/or graphs that we could create?
Another possible graph we could have shown was to create a graph that shows the length of each campaign compared the the success. We could find out if creating a longer deadline can help lift the chances of the campaign being more succesful. Filtering it by country can also help us determine whether it is more successful in other countries.
